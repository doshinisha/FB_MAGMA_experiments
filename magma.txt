Hi Zongze,
 The links for ramping up on Magma from our in-house expert:

--
For a beginner tutorial, I'd recommend the magmathon: https://github.com/phanrahan/magmathon

Start by following the setup instructions: https://github.com/phanrahan/magmathon#setup-and-installation
Then walk through the tutorial notebooks here: https://github.com/phanrahan/magmathon/tree/master/notebooks/tutorial/coreir

Once they are through that, they can then walk through the register file tutorial: https://github.com/leonardt/magma_register_file_tutorial

After that, they should be good to go to start writing some real magma code and tests.

Feel free to put them in contact with me/Raj to help them with any questions or getting setup on their local machines.


Regards
Varghese
